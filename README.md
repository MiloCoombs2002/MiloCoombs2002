## About Me
I'm currently completing my **Masterâ€™s in Physics (MPhys)** at **Durham University**, where I graduated **2nd in my cohort** with a **First Class with Honours**. My passion lies at the intersection of **physics**, **quantitative finance**, and **data analysis**, with a strong focus on applying advanced computational techniques to solve real-world problems.

In my internships and academic projects, Iâ€™ve honed my expertise in **Python, SQL, data management**, and **quantitative trading strategies**. My technical acumen, combined with my leadership roles at Durham and professional experience, enables me to thrive in both academic and professional environments.

## Key Areas of Expertise:
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, C++, Excel, Pandas, Numpy
- **Data Analysis**: Statistical mechanics, predictive modeling, financial data analysis, algorithmic trading
- **Project Management**: Agile methodologies, Jira, stakeholder communication
- **Cloud Computing**: Developed and deployed API-based solutions in Azure for real-time portfolio management
- **Quantitative Finance**: Mean reversion, arbitrage strategies, risk-adjusted returns optimization
## Professional Experience

- Conducted audits that led to potential savings of Â£60,000 for housing associations.
- Implemented data extraction improvements, increasing audit efficiency by 21%.
## Featured Projects
#### Quantum Mechanics Research Project
- Developed **predictive models** using Python to simulate electron behavior, improving accuracy in forecasting complex data-driven predictions.
- **Published a new equation** for kinetic energy, soon to appear in the **Journal of Chemical Physics**.
#### Quantitative Fund Management
- Led a team to deploy **mean reversion** and **arbitrage trading** strategies on QuantConnect, achieving an 8% simulated return over six months.
- **Programmed custom algorithms** to optimize performance based on the **Sharpe ratio** and reduce portfolio volatility.
## Courses and Certifications
