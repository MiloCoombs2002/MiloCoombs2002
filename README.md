Theory-driven machine learning.

This GitHub hosts research code and experiments focused on
approximation theory, spectral representations, and interpretable
models for tabular data.

Most repositories are research-oriented and may accompany working
papers or ongoing investigations. Code is written with an emphasis on
clarity, structure, and reproducibility rather than production scale.

## Current themes
- Spectral and harmonic representations
- Approximation-theoretic perspectives on learning
- Interpretable models for tabular data
- Geometry and structure in high-dimensional regression

## Notes
Some projects are exploratory or incomplete by design. Repositories
typically reflect ideas in progress rather than polished libraries.
