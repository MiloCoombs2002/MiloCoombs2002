# Welcome to My GitHub Profile 👋  

## About Me  
I’m a passionate **physicist and data scientist** with a strong foundation in **machine learning, quantitative finance**, and **computational problem-solving**. I recently completed my **Master’s in Physics (MPhys)** at **Durham University**, graduating **2nd in my cohort** with a **First Class with Honours**.  

Currently, I’m focusing on enhancing my expertise in **machine learning**, **algorithmic trading**, and **quantum computing** through independent projects and advanced coursework. My professional experience in **data science**, **portfolio management**, and **quantitative strategies** complements my academic background, enabling me to tackle complex, real-world challenges with innovative solutions.  

## Key Areas of Expertise  
- **Programming Languages**: Python, SQL, C++, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SciKit-Learn, Pandas, Linux  
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Predictive modelling, reinforcement learning, statistical arbitrage, data visualisation  
- **Quantitative Finance**: Algorithmic trading strategies (mean reversion, arbitrage), risk-adjusted returns optimisation, portfolio management  
- **Cloud Computing**: Deployed ML-based solutions on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Azure  
- **Research & Analysis**: Density Functional Theory (DFT), quantum mechanics, electron behaviour simulations  

## Professional Experience  
#### Project Delivery Manager @ Finbourne Technology (2024 – 2025)  
- Designed scalable **Python pipelines** to improve model evaluation efficiency for traders.  
- Built **automated workflows** in SQL and Python for Bloomberg data integration, reducing manual effort by 20%.  
- Created Python-based demos and **Power BI dashboards** to enhance portfolio transparency and client engagement.  

#### Financial Data Analysis Intern @ Beever and Struthers (2022)  
- Conducted audits that led to potential savings of £60,000 for housing associations.  
- Improved audit efficiency by 21% through the implementation of data extraction enhancements using Excel macros.  

#### Professional Development (2025 – Present)  
- Developed a **reinforcement learning trading strategy**, achieving a simulated 5% annualised return.  
- Completed the **Machine Learning Specialisation** (DeepLearning.AI) and statistical arbitrage coursework using GCP.  

## Featured Projects  
#### ML-Based Quantitative Strategy Development  
- Built a **risk management framework** using ML algorithms and a sliding window technique to optimise for data volatility.  
- Focused on reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust trading strategies for market conditions.  

#### Quantum Mechanics Research Project  
- Developed predictive models with **Python and DFT** to simulate electron behaviour, improving the accuracy of data-driven predictions.  
- Published a **new equation for electron kinetic energy**, forthcoming in the **Journal of Chemical Physics**.  

#### Quantitative Fund Management  
- Led a team implementing **mean reversion** and **arbitrage trading strategies** on QuantConnect, achieving an 8% simulated return.  
- Optimised **neural networks** using TensorFlow to maximise the **Sharpe ratio** and minimise portfolio risk.  

## Courses and Certifications  
- **Machine Learning Specialisation** – DeepLearning.AI (2025)  
- **Introduction to Trading, Machine Learning and GCP** – New York Institute of Finance (2025)  
- **Algorithmic Trading and Finance Models with Python, R, and Stata** – LinkedIn Learning (2024)  

## Interests  
Outside of academics and work, I’m a passionate musician, serving as the **lead guitarist in a jazz band**, and an avid sports enthusiast, enjoying rowing, tennis, and captaining my university’s **first men’s netball team**.
